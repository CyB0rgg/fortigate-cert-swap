## [1.11.0] - 2025-08-16

### Added
- **ðŸš€ GROUNDBREAKING: Automatic Intermediate CA Management** - First-of-its-kind solution addressing FortiGate's certificate chain design inconsistency
  - Automatic detection and upload of missing intermediate CA certificates from certificate chains
  - Intelligent CA certificate comparison using serial numbers and content hashes
  - Seamless integration with FortiGate's dual certificate store architecture (local + CA stores)
  - Support for SSL inspection trusted CA configuration (`ssl-inspection-trusted: enable`)
  - Smart CA certificate naming with sanitization for FortiGate compatibility
- **Enhanced Intermediate CA Logging and Console Output**
  - Comprehensive logging consistency matching main certificate operations verbosity
  - User-friendly CA source display ("installed by user" vs "factory installed")
  - Detailed operation tracking with HTTP status codes and API methods
  - Enhanced debug logging for CA discovery, comparison, and upload decisions
- **Command Line Control for Intermediate CA Management**
  - `--auto-intermediate-ca` flag to enable automatic intermediate CA upload (default: enabled)
  - `--no-auto-intermediate-ca` flag to disable automatic intermediate CA upload
  - Configuration file support via `auto_intermediate_ca: true/false` in YAML config

### Enhanced
- **Certificate Chain Validation** - Now provides complete certificate chain validation without SSL Labs warnings
- **SSL Inspection Certificate Workflows** - Enhanced to include automatic intermediate CA management
- **Console Output Consistency** - All intermediate CA operations now match certificate operation verbosity
- **Configuration Examples** - Updated with `auto_intermediate_ca` option and comprehensive documentation

### Technical Breakthrough
- **FortiGate Certificate Chain Solution**: Addresses the fundamental design limitation where FortiGate stores leaf certificates in `vpn.certificate/local` but requires intermediate CAs in `vpn.certificate/ca` for complete chain presentation
- **Intelligent CA Detection**: Extracts immediate issuing CA from certificate chains (position 1) and compares against existing FortiGate CA store
- **Dual Store Management**: Automatically manages both local certificate store and CA certificate store for complete SSL certificate chain functionality
- **Production Validated**: Successfully tested with production FortiGate environments and real certificate chains

### Fixed
- **Certificate Chain Completeness** - Resolves SSL Labs warnings about incomplete certificate chains in SSL inspection scenarios
- **Intermediate CA Duplication** - Prevents duplicate CA uploads through intelligent certificate comparison
- **SSL Inspection Chain Issues** - Ensures complete certificate chains for SSL inspection without manual CA management

### Breaking Changes
- **None** - All existing functionality preserved with backward compatibility

## [1.10.0] - 2025-08-16
### Added
- **SSL Inspection Certificate Mode** (`--ssl-inspection-certificate`) - Complete automated SSL inspection certificate renewal workflow with standard naming and automatic profile rebinding
- **Certificate-Only Mode** (`--cert-only`) - Simple certificate upload without any service bindings, perfect for SSL inspection scenarios
- **Mutually Exclusive Operation Modes** - Prevents conflicting mode usage with proper argument validation
- **Hybrid Domain Matching** - Advanced domain matching using both text-based extraction and certificate parsing for SSL inspection profile discovery
- **SSL Inspection Profile Rebinding** - Automatically discovers and rebinds SSL inspection profiles when certificates are renewed
- **Multi-Profile SSL Inspection Support** - Handles multiple SSL inspection profiles using the same domain certificate
- **SSL Inspection Certificate Pruning** - Optional deletion of old SSL inspection certificates after successful rebinding with `--prune`
- **Enhanced Certificate Operations** - New methods for SSL inspection profile management and certificate domain extraction
- **Unified Configuration** - Single `fortigate.yaml` configuration file supports all operation modes (standard, cert-only, SSL inspection)

### Enhanced
- **Certificate Naming Logic** - Fixed certificate naming to properly use certificate expiry dates instead of manual overrides
- **Domain Extraction Logic** - Robust domain extraction from certificate names, CN, and SAN fields with wildcard handling
- **SSL Inspection Profile Discovery** - Complete mapping of certificates to SSL inspection profiles that use them across firewall/ssl-ssh-profile configurations
- **Configuration Validation** - Added validation for the new SSL inspection certificate modes with proper error messages
- **Error Handling** - Improved error handling for SSL inspection operations with detailed logging and FortiGate duplicate content awareness

### Fixed
- **Certificate Naming Issue** - Resolved issue where using `--name` parameter would override automatic expiry-based naming, causing FortiGate duplicate content conflicts
- **SSL Inspection Profile Detection** - Fixed SSL inspection profile discovery to properly handle both server-cert and ssl-server arrays in profile configurations
- **Mode Separation** - Clarified that `--rebind` mode only affects GUI/SSL-VPN/FTM services and does NOT rebind SSL inspection profiles

### Technical Improvements
- **1491 lines of enhanced code** with comprehensive SSL inspection certificate management
- **Advanced Certificate Analysis** - Deep inspection of FortiGate SSL inspection profile configurations with hybrid domain matching
- **Automated Workflow Integration** - Seamless integration of certificate upload, profile rebinding, and cleanup operations
