# Example FortiGate config for SSL inspection certificate mode
# This configuration is optimized for automated SSL inspection certificate swapping
# with standard naming, profile rebinding, and optional pruning

# FortiGate connection settings
host: fortigate.example.com
port: 8443
token: "YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE"

# Certificate store (omit vdom for GLOBAL, or specify VDOM name)
# vdom: "root"

# Security settings
insecure: true        # Use if FortiGate has self-signed cert
dry_run: false        # Set to true for testing

# SSL inspection certificate mode settings
# This mode uploads certificates with standard naming and automatically
# rebinds SSL inspection profiles based on domain matching
ssl_inspection_cert: true

# Pruning settings (optional)
# prune: true         # Delete old SSL inspection certificates after successful rebinding

# Timeouts (seconds)
timeout_connect: 10
timeout_read: 60

# Logging (recommended for production)
log: "~/logs/ssl-inspection-cert-update.log"
log_level: "standard"  # or "debug" for detailed logging

# Note: This mode will:
# 1. Upload certificate with standard naming (domain-YYYYMMDD)
# 2. Find SSL inspection profiles using certificates for the same domain
# 3. Rebind those profiles to use the new certificate
# 4. Optionally prune old certificates if --prune is enabled
